* EECS 692 reproduction project

Work reproduced: Jaderberg, Max, Karen Simonyan, and Andrew Zisserman. "Spatial transformer networks." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2015.

I reproduced two experiments and added two extensions

The fourth experiments in my reproduction report consist of sensitive data, so code not shown here

To reproduce the first three experiments (assumes has gpu), run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bash run1.sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bash run2.sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bash run3.sh
#+END_SRC
